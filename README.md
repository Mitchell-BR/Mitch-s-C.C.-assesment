p.5js Week 4:for loop 'oscillating circles'
You start by setting the variables, and then in 'setup' you setup the for loop. Using push () pop() and another for loop() for the lines and ellipses, they are suposed to be linear moving meeting the black ellipse at each end of the line, making it look like one big circle made from the ellipses going around the cirlce perimeter. 
p.5js week 5:noise 'Blobby'
So this is a big yellow circle made from verticies, using a for loop and noise you can move the vertex's of the circle creating 'blobby'.
p.5js week 5: noise 'worm' 
You start by setting variables and the parameters of the cirle or worm thing, and by using noise and incrementing offset to move circle over time making a 'worm'.
Touch Designer week 10: lil planets 
This works by filing everything like your grid'd shape, noise, phong through to the geo network and by playing the camera, lighting and other things like colour you end up with a grid of spheres moving like they're in a wave pool. 
Touch Designer week 10: particles
Using the particles gpu, select, math, with a audio file in/out and a audio analysis they generate the particles through the audio, I then used a ramp to change the colours of them, it almost looks like a far away galaxy in space to me. 
Touch Designer week 11: Twisting circle
This works by getting a sphere sop and changing the primitive type lowering the rows and collums and filtering that through a twist sop and a noise sop to get the movement. The geo and cam through the render record the thing, the last tops just mess with the colour and colour of this network and comes out with this moving shape we've never seen before.
